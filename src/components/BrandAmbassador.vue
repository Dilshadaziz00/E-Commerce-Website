                        <p>Fakhar Zaman is one of Pakistan’s most aggressive opening batsmen, known for his fearless
                            stroke play and ability to score big runs quickly. Born in Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he
                            initially served in the Pakistan Navy before pursuing a professional cricket career. His
                            breakthrough moment came in the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, where he played a historic knock
                            in the final against India, scoring a match-winning century (114 off 106 balls). His
                            performance in that tournament cemented his place in the national team and made him a
                            household name in Pakistan cricket. </p>

                        <p>In 2018, Fakhar became the first Pakistani batsman to score a double century in ODIs,
                            smashing 210 runs* against Zimbabwe. His record-breaking innings not only showcased his
                            ability to bat for long periods but also demonstrated his attacking mindset, making him one
                            of Pakistan's most dangerous batsmen in white-ball cricket. Fakhar was also a key player in
                            Pakistan’s rise in limited-overs formats, often providing blistering starts and putting
                            opposition bowlers under pressure early in the innings.

                        </p>

                        <p> Over the years, Fakhar has been a consistent performer for Pakistan in ODIs and T20Is,
                            forming crucial partnerships at the top of the order. His ability to score quick runs,
                            especially in high-pressure matches, makes him an invaluable asset. With his experience and
                            aggressive batting approach, he remains one of Pakistan’s most dependable openers, capable
                            of turning the game in his team's favor within a few overs. Whether playing against
                            top-ranked teams or lower-ranked sides, Fakhar’s presence at the crease is always a threat
                            to the opposition.</p>
